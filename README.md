# fundamentals of computer programming class  

Session #1 Getting set up:  
- ssh to your linux instance; don't lose your ssh key!
- access your github repository at https://github.com; remember the content can be seen by anybody!
- be able to git clone this repo: git clone git@github.com:CFields651/fundclass.git
- register for openweathermap.org api
- call the openweathermap api:  
curl -s "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=55427,us&units=imperial&APPID=< your api key here > 

Session #2 BASH command line from codeacademy:   
- Navigation: pwd, ls, cd, cd .., mkdir, touch  
- Manipulation: ls -alt, cat, cp, mv, rm, rm -r  
- Redirection: > (write), >> (append), | (pipe), sort, uniq, grep, grep -R, sed 's/text to find/text to replace it with/g' filename.txt
- from me: don't forget the 'cd' simply takes you back to your 'home' directory

Session #3 BASH scripts
- Do lessons 1, 2 and 3 from http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/   
- On lesson 3 you should stop when you get to the 'Reading from STDin' section
