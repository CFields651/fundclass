# fundamentals of computer programming class  

Session #1 Getting set up 
After this class you should be able to:
- ssh to your Amazon EC2 Red Hat Linux instance; don't lose your ssh key!

curl -s "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=55427,us&units=imperial&APPID=< your api key here > 

Session #2 BASH command line from codeacademy  
- HOMEWORK: Do the first three sessions of this codeacademy tutorial: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line  
After this class you should have basic knowledge of:
- Navigation: pwd, ls, cd, cd .., mkdir, touch  
- Manipulation: ls -alt, cat, cp, mv, rm, rm -r  
- Redirection: > (write), >> (append), | (pipe), sort, uniq, grep, grep -R, sed 's/text to find/text to replace it with/g' filename.txt
- from me: don't forget the 'cd' simply takes you back to your 'home' directory

Session #3 BASH scripts
- HOMEWORK: Do lessons 1, 2 and 3 from http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/
